# flask-nanoblog

## Nanoblogging python-webapp

Just a bored afternoon, pushed me to play with Flask Python web-framework and MongoEngine.

MongoEngine = The object-document mapper to connect Python and MongoDB
Flask = A microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions


This can be considered a Fork of http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/write-a-tumblelog-application-with-flask-mongoengine/

There is all what you need to do something with more value.

I'd just did my version, a nano one!
